# Fleem ðŸš€

Create customizable React projects with ease using this powerful CLI tool.

## Installation

To install the CLI globally, run:

```bash
npm install -g fleem
```

This will make the command `fleem` available globally.

## Usage

To create a new React project, simply run the command:

```bash
fleem <projectName> [options]
```

You will be guided step-by-step through the project setup with interactive prompts. You can also pass specific options directly.

### Example

```bash
fleem my-app --typescript --jest --scss
```

This command will create a React project named `my-app` using TypeScript, Jest for testing, and SCSS for styling.

After project creation, the tool will install the necessary dependencies, set up your chosen configurations, and initialize a Git repository (if specified).

### Available Commands

- `fleem <projectName> [options]`: Generate a new project with customizable options.

Example:

```bash
fleem my-app --routing --state-management redux
```

This command creates a new project with React Router and Redux for state management.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error during project creation, the tool will attempt to clean up by removing the project directory. In case the issue persists, please verify:
1. You have Node.js 14 or higher installed.
2. The directory you're trying to create the project in doesn't already exist.
3. Ensure you're running the CLI in an environment with the necessary permissions to create directories and install packages.
